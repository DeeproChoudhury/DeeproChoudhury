### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Deepro, a current masters scholar at Cambridge University.

I'm interested in the intersection between mathematics and computer science. This includes 
 - Formal theorem proving and its automation.
 - Machine learning and its mathematical foundations.
 - Interpretability of neural networks.
 - Algebra and Category Theory
